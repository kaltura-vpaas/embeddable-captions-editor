# Kaltura Caption Editor Embed
A guide to embed the Kaltura Caption Editor in your web application. Kaltura has a rich [captioning Experience](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/using-subtitles-and-captions) that is available in the [KMC](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/login)

However, you also are able to embed the caption editor by itself as shown below:

![captions_embed](readme_assets/captions_embed.png)

To use the demo, supply a media entry id from your account that can be acquired via:https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/media/action/list

The caption editor will only work with media entries that already have existing captions. If you wanted to create an experience where captions are able to be added for the first time, you could create a blank [CaptionAsset](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/captionAsset) by following this workflow:
